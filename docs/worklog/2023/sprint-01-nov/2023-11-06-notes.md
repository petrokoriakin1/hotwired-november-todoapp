Hey hello!

The time is over and that's why I'm posting the results even they are not yed completed enough. The prfectionist procrastinator trap catched me again. I was too focused on polishing backend part.

Here are few links and the screens:

- free fly.io instance deployment https://hotwired-november-todoapp.fly.dev/
- the plan with ETAs and progress https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VRfKHLN4DM_HnPvqmxH8msVrwcPgn37QhnNI8N36mkw/edit?usp=sharing
- My conversation with chatGPT: https://chat.openai.com/share/bc1e39ba-e212-4b6f-8dbc-c5d69d7cf5aa
- source code, available for `pranavbabu`: https://github.com/petrokoriakin1/hotwired-november-todoapp

### Items competed:

● Ruby on Rails
● Hotwire, including Turbo Frames.
● PostgreSQL for the database
● A few lines of Stimulus.js for client-side behavior
● free fly.io instance deployment and dockerisation
● Tailwind css library.
● Errors are handeled gracefully and few user-friendly error messages are provided.
● Rspec used to cover the code with tests.

### Items remaining:
● Add front end code for remaining functionality like adding a section to existing list, dashboard tasklist and template managemtnt etc.
● Add drag-and-drop functionality for reordering tasks using Hotwire and Stimulus js
● Implement user authentication and authorization.

My next steps are
- deploy current updates to free fly.io instance
- learn turbostreams
- make test task front end codebase a bit better with some more Turbo Streams and Stimulus js

P.S. In case you already choosed another candidate over my application - just let me know
