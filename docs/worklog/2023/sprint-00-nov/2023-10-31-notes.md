Dear Sawadee Team,

I'm excited by the culture, focus on sustainable solutions, and Ruby being a core part of tech stack. It makes my decade-long experience a great match with currently open Senior Backend Engineer role. I believe my skills and attitude align well with your collaborative and agile environment.

Given  Sawadee's open culture, green practices and awesome people, I am drawn to the opportunity to contribute to projects that shape the traveling of tomorrow.

Thank you for considering my application. I am available for further discussions at your convenience.

Warm regards,
Petro Koriakin
